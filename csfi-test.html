				<h2>Determine Readiness</h2>
				
				<div class="block">
					<img src="images/determine-1.png" alt="">
					<h3>Target the Fundamentals</h3>
					<p>In use by colleges and universities for over twenty years, the College Success Factors Index (CSFI) contains 100 self-scoring statements designed to determine college students’ readiness to successfully complete their early years in higher education.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="block">
					<img src="images/determine-2.png" alt="">
					<h3>Uncover Affective Factors That Predict Student Success</h3>
					<p>Many factors indicate potential success in higher education – notably high school grades and SAT/ACT scores. However, other factors, which often go unmeasured, have a place in retention and success. For example, how a student uses his time may be more critical than academic records. CSFI 2.0’s approach uncovers these often “hidden” factors.</p>
				</div>
				
				<hr class="sub-panel-faded-divider">
				<h2>Assess Scores</h2>

				<div class="block">
					<img src="images/assess-1.png" alt="">
					<h3>Measure What Matters Most</h3>
					<p>With its comprehensive criteria, the College Success Factors Index delivers practical, predictive value for anyone working with college-bound and first-year students. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					<img src="images/assess-2.png" alt="">
					<p>Instructors can easily generate reports showing not only overall class scores, but also individual students’ scores, and can customize these reports to show information only from a set timeframe or to compare results from more than one semester. </p>
				</div>

				<hr class="sub-panel-faded-divider">
				<h2>Intervene Earlier</h2>

				<div class="block">
					<img src="images/intervene-1.png" alt="">
					<h3>Gain an Early Alert</h3>
					<p>The College Success Factors Index also serves to foster advising or interventions for low-scoring students. Early Alert functionality lets students and staff identify areas of  improvement on or before the first day of school. For example, a student with an overall score high enough for university work may show weakness in time management. With this information in hand, student and teacher can investigate time management improvement options. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="block">
					<img src="images/intervene-2.png" alt="">
					<p>Instructors can quickly gain a snapshot of at-risk students by checking off the first option in the “Display Filtering” section before generating a report. The report will then show only results for students who have fallen below the watchline on 4 or more of the CSFI factors.</p>
